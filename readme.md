*script is provided as is, do not expect troubleshooting support. Use at your own risk.


This script was created and tested on windows 7. 

Optimized for windowed use at (mostly) any resolution. 

Since the game uses adaptive interface, at certain window resolutions and aspect ratios, script might drift off, so it will miss buttons. To fix it, try readjusting the window slightly. Fullscreen should work fine.
